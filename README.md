## Overview

This project analyzes how Bankrate could optimize lender assignment decisions to increase revenue per application while maintaining consistent loan offers for users.

Using a rule-based approach, I compared Bankrate’s current lender assignment strategy against a simplified optimization rule that routes applicants to lenders offering higher revenue per approval, based on borrower characteristics such as credit score bands.

The goal was to quantify expected revenue uplift and demonstrate how small changes in routing logic could have meaningful business impact.

## Key Insights

Certain credit score segments showed significant revenue variation across lenders despite identical offers

A simple rule-based assignment strategy produced a measurable uplift in expected revenue

This approach balances interpretability, scalability, and business alignment, making it suitable for real-world deployment
